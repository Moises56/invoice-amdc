# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to improve the user interface layout of the estado-cuenta and estado-cuenta-amnistia pages to match the clean, modern design of the consulta-ics page. Currently, both estado-cuenta pages have overlapping headers, cluttered indicators, and inconsistent spacing that creates a poor user experience. The goal is to standardize the UI layout across all consultation pages for better visual consistency and usability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user accessing the estado-cuenta page, I want a clean and uncluttered header layout, so that I can easily navigate and focus on the main content without visual distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the estado-cuenta page THEN the system SHALL display a single, clean header without overlapping elements
2. WHEN the user scrolls the page THEN the system SHALL maintain proper header spacing and avoid content overlap
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL use consistent header styling that matches the consulta-ics design pattern

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user accessing the estado-cuenta-amnistia page, I want the same clean header layout as other consultation pages, so that I have a consistent experience across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the estado-cuenta-amnistia page THEN the system SHALL display a clean header layout identical to the consulta-ics pattern
2. WHEN the user navigates between consultation pages THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency in header design
3. WHEN the page renders THEN the system SHALL eliminate any overlapping or redundant header elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing search results on estado-cuenta pages, I want properly spaced and organized content sections, so that I can easily read and understand the information presented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing between content sections
2. WHEN multiple content cards are shown THEN the system SHALL apply uniform margins and padding
3. WHEN the page contains search forms and results THEN the system SHALL organize them with clear visual hierarchy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want the estado-cuenta pages to have responsive layouts that work well on small screens, so that I can access the information comfortably on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the page on mobile THEN the system SHALL display content with appropriate mobile-optimized spacing
2. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout while maintaining the clean design principles
3. WHEN touch interactions occur THEN the system SHALL provide adequate touch targets and spacing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want consistent CSS classes and styling patterns across all consultation pages, so that the code is maintainable and follows established design standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the layout fixes THEN the system SHALL reuse existing CSS classes from consulta-ics where applicable
2. WHEN creating new styles THEN the system SHALL follow the established naming conventions and design patterns
3. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN the system SHALL have consistent styling architecture across all consultation pages
